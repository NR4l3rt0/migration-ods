This repository continues the idea developed in the repo 'bash-app-parallelism' and will help in OpenDevStack's migration towards 4.x. For that reason, this application attempts to enhance the functionality of the converter tool, since it will be part of the building and synchronicity phases (each project with other monitoring projects). Besides, it will report the state of the changes.

The intention is to do it in a modular way (as if it were plugins):
- Jenkinsfile
- Metadata
- Other resources...
